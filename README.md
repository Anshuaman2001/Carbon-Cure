# Carbon-Cure
Carbon Tracking & Reduction Web Platform
Overview
The Carbon Tracking & Reduction Web Platform is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) application designed to help companies track their carbon emissions, set reduction goals, receive AI-based recommendations, and integrate with carbon offset programs. It provides real-time analytics, reporting, and actionable insights to help companies make data-driven decisions toward sustainability.

Features
Carbon Tracking Dashboard:

Monitor real-time carbon emissions.
Input data for energy usage, transportation, manufacturing, and waste.
Visualize trends over time through interactive graphs and charts.
AI-Based Emission Reduction Recommendations:

AI algorithms analyze carbon data and provide tailored suggestions.
Set reduction goals based on industry benchmarks.
Personalized recommendations to reduce emissions in areas like logistics, production, and energy use.
Integration with Carbon Offset Programs:

Integrates with third-party APIs to allow companies to invest in carbon offset projects.
Track contributions and measure the impact of offset initiatives.
Real-Time Reporting and Analytics:

Generate detailed reports with emission breakdowns.
Track progress against set goals.
Download reports for regulatory compliance and CSR purposes.
User Roles and Permissions:

Admin panel for managing team members and assigning roles.
Role-based access ensures secure handling of company data.
Technology Stack
Frontend:
React.js: For building the interactive user interface.
Redux: For state management across the application.
Chart.js: For data visualization (charts, graphs).
Backend:
Node.js: Backend server with Express.js for handling API requests and business logic.
MongoDB: Database to store emissions data, user profiles, and reports.
Socket.io: For real-time data updates in the dashboard.
AI & Machine Learning:
TensorFlow.js or Python Microservices with Scikit-learn for implementing AI algorithms to analyze carbon data.
Google Cloud AI/ML APIs: For carbon footprint analysis and predictions.
Authentication:
JWT (JSON Web Token): For secure authentication.
OAuth2: For third-party logins (e.g., Google, LinkedIn).
Cloud Services:
AWS or Google Cloud: For cloud storage and processing.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/carbon-tracking-platform.git
cd carbon-tracking-platform
Install dependencies for the backend:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
npm install
Install dependencies for the frontend:

bash
Copy code
cd ../frontend
npm install
Set up environment variables:

Create a .env file in both the backend and frontend folders.
Add the following variables (modify as needed):
bash
Copy code
# Backend .env
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/carbon-tracking
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
API_KEY=your_third_party_api_key

# Frontend .env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
Start the backend server:

bash
Copy code
cd ../backend
npm start
Start the frontend server:

bash
Copy code
cd ../frontend
npm start
The application should now be running locally at http://localhost:3000.

Usage
Admin Setup: The company admin registers and sets up the organizationâ€™s profile.
Data Input: Authorized users input carbon data related to energy, transport, and manufacturing.
AI Recommendations: The system provides emission reduction suggestions based on the inputted data.
Tracking Progress: Use the dashboard to track real-time metrics and visualize emission trends.
Carbon Offset: Integrate with third-party programs to neutralize emissions and track investments.
API Integration
This platform integrates with several third-party APIs:

Carbon Interface API: For estimating carbon emissions.
CO2Signal API: To track real-time carbon intensity.
Patch API: For carbon offset projects.
Cloverly API: To offset carbon emissions via automated purchases.
AI Recommendations
The platform uses machine learning models to analyze historical carbon data and provide actionable insights:

TensorFlow.js or Scikit-learn models are used to predict future emissions and offer reduction strategies.
Models are trained using historical emissions data and optimized for real-time recommendations.
